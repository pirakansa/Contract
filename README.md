# Repo Contract

Repo Contract is a CLI-first implementation of the Code Contract concept,
which defines machine-readable contracts that govern how code is allowed
to be created or changed by humans and AI.

While this project currently targets Git repositories,
the Code Contract concept is designed to extend beyond repositories
to files, workspaces, and organizations.
